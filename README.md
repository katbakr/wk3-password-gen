## Description
This is an application that takes user inputs to create a randomly generated password using user choices for length, lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and special characters. This can be used to quickly create secure passwords that can be copied and used for users to avoid using repeat or easy passwords for websites. I learned how to properly use functions, if else statements, and for loops to pull from a random list of characters to create a random list using user input options.

## Usage
To use this application, a user should start by clicking the "Generate Password" button. This should prompt a window that will ask the user questions about their password preferances. These go over characters like lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters. After they answer these questions their password should display in the box previously labeled with "your secure password". If a user fails to input any password character options, the window should tell them to choose at least one character option from the prompts.
